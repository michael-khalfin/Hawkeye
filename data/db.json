      "title": "Illnesses During a Pandemic",
      "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic has left many people stuck at home in isolation. Although these measures have helped decrease the spread of the virus, there has been an upsurge in other illnesses. For example, sleep disorders have been on the rise. Getting a good night's sleep is crucial because it allows an individual to recharge for the day and helps their body fight off diseases. This is why poor sleep results in catastrophic health issues. \\n The negative outcomes of the pandemic, such as isolation and job loss, have significantly harmed mental health. In fact, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, four out of ten adults in the U.S have developed an anxiety disorder since the start of the pandemic. The shift towards a more digital path has further increased the prevalence of these issues. Quarantine has given people the opportunity to spend more time on their phones and watch TV due to a lack of meaningful activities. The New York Times found that there has been a 16% and 15.4% increase in use of streaming services such as Netflix and Youtube, respectively. \\n Furthermore, learning from home has led to a drastic increase in using Zoom, Google Classroom, and Google Meet. However, staring at a screen for long periods of time can be especially detrimental because it can significantly disrupt someone’s sleep schedule. Too much screen time could result in eye fatigue, dry eyes, loss of focus, and retinal damage. Additionally, the pandemic has also been harmful to physical health. Due to a loss of physical activity, there has been an increase in muscle and joint pain. \\n For this reason, it is important to consider the impacts of screen time on health and to take a break every once in a while. This summer, it would be especially beneficial to consider ways to decrease screen time with new activities (such as reading a book, playing a sport, solving a puzzle, riding a bike, learning a new language, taking up an instrument, etc.) and to take this opportunity to reflect on both mental and physical health.",

      "title": "Embarking on the Path Back to “Normal”",
      "body": "With summer around the corner, Americans are beginning to see the restrictions on masks loosen. The CDC recently announced on April 27 that fully vaccinated people are no longer required to wear a mask outdoors. That being said, partaking in outdoor activities, such as jogging and biking, or eating at outdoor restaurants are now permitted. However, officials still state that crowded settings and venues are exceptions to the easing of these precautions. For those who have not been vaccinated, the previous stringent guidelines still follow. Even the completely vaccinated still face many limits to the actions and contact they can make. Nonetheless, Americans are feeling a greater sense of normalcy as progress is made during this pandemic. \\n As of May 6, the CDC’s website reports that about 45% of the total population and 57% of those 18 and older have received at least one shot from the vaccination series. For teenagers, only those who are 16 and older are currently able to receive the vaccine under emergency authorization. In an effort to increase the number of vaccinated students before the next school year, Pfizer has been working towards expanding the use of vaccines for those between the ages of 12-15. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to deliver the decision of authorizing the vaccine for this age group early next week. [Update: the FDA has approved Pfizer’s request to extend vaccines to 12-15-year-olds]. \\n Although vaccines lower the risk of being infected by COVID-19, people should always keep in mind that they are still susceptible to infection, especially when finding themselves in high-risk settings. \\n Further updates and statistics may be found at the CDC’s official website.",

      "title": "Exciting News For Cycling Enthusiasts",
      "body": "For as long as I can remember, one of my favorite hobbies has been cycling. Nothing is more appealing to me during the Spring, Summer, and Fall months than biking as many miles as possible. \\n In many aspects, Long Island is an avid cyclist’s dream, especially near JFK high school where the start of Bethpage Bikeway is easily accessible. A person can follow this trail for 13.4 miles, from Manetto Hill and Woodbury Road (Woodbury) to Merrick Road and Ocean Ave. (Massapequa). The trail is ordinarily quiet and peaceful and includes beautiful foliage due to the abundance of trees. Massapequa Park (part of Massapequa Preserve) is located at the end of the trail and overlooks the navy blue Massapequa Lake. Since there is a nice walkway and plenty of rest areas, this is a common destination for my friends and me on short and frequent bike rides. \\n For longer bike rides, we often pass Massapequa Park and continue on Sunrise Highway until we reach Cedar Creek Park. Safety concerns are not problematic because there is a decent shoulder width and the total distance is 3-4 miles at most. Cedar Creek Park has the entrance to the Ocean Parkway bike path, which runs for 4 miles, ending at Jones Beach. Finally, the Ocean Parkway Coastal Greenway used to run for another 4 miles to Tobay Beach. However, the last time I visited the trail with my friends, we saw something astonishing: the trail was closed for heavy maintenance. Dejected and mounting feelings of disappointment, we were forced to turn around and return home. \\n Later that night, curled in a blanket with a cup of tea in hand, I decided to search up “Ocean Parkway Coastal Greenway” and see what the issue was. Within mere seconds, my dismay over not completing the bike ride turned into pure euphoric bliss. They were adding an extension to the trail, which was going to be completed by June 2021. Cyclists, runners, skaters, and walkers alike would be able to travel an additional 10 miles to Captree State Park. Excitedly, I texted my friend, and we instantly began brainstorming the possibilities: having a “beach day” at West Gilgo Beach; taking pictures and watching sunsets by Cedar Beach; and most importantly, completing 62 miles in total, with no need to make the same trip twice or rely on extra road mileage. \\n Fast forward to the beginning of May, and the trail is open to the public. The news was announced in early March, just in time for warm weather. Ocean Parkway Coastal Greenway now spans the towns of Babylon and Islip. Hundreds of plants native to Long Island, including beach grass, evergreen trees, bayberry plants, and beach plums, line the new path. Also, people using the trail can view numerous educational panels with historical and environmental information. \\n Coastal Greenway is certain to become a tourist attraction, similar to Montauk or the Hamptons. Discover Long Island CEO and President Kristen Jarnegin has expressed, “The addition of this new oceanfront... connects to additional trails and boasts stunning view of the Manhattan skyline and... is certain to be a favorite for both residents and visitors alike.” The trail is bound to attract all outdoorsy people, regardless of their interests. Personally, this is a dream come true, and I am invigorated by all the possibilities.",

      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",
